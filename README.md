Work done for the Spring'24 offering of EE337: Microprocessors Lab.
This repository contains all the Keil uVision5 project files, 8051 assembly .asm, embedded C .c, .h code files that were used to program the PT-51 microcontroller (which uses ATMEL AT89C5131A) designed by Wadhwani Electronics Lab and the .hex files that were dumped on the board using FLIP 3.4.7. The lab projects involved interfacing of the microcontroller with other peripherals such as LCD display, LM35 temperature sensor, speaker, PL2303 UART board, MCP3008 ADC .etc
